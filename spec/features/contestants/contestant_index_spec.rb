# As a visitor,
# When I visit the contestants index page ("/contestants")
# I see a list of names of all the contestants
# And under each contestants name I see a list of the projects (names) that they've been on

# (e.g.   Kentaro Kameyama
#         Projects: Litfit, Rug Tuxedo

#         Jay McCarroll
#         Projects: LeatherFeather)
